            IF THE CONTEXT DOESN'T MENTION A SELFIE
            Based on the following section from a text adventure game:\n{last_message}\n\nGenerate a short yet decriptive image prompt for Stable Diffusion to create a POV, first person view image of what the player would be seeing at that point in the game. Keep it short, yet efficiently descriptive.
            
            <GENERAL NON-SELFIE EXAMPLES>
            a pov photo showing a man's office, with a nice futuristic desk and a big TV. dark room, candid, pov
            
            POV photo looking at a garage with an e46 m3 parked inside, with dirty oil stains on the floor, mechanics working on cars in background. dark gritty garage, candid, pov photo

            Keep it short, and use words to prompt low-quality photos taken with a phone.
            
            SELFIES
            IF, and ONLY IF the section of text EXPLICITLY mentions a SELFIE, THEN:
            Based on the following section from a text adventure game:\n{last_message}\n\n use the information in the following text:\n{self.image_prompt}\n\nGenerate a detailed image prompt for Stable Diffusion to create a selfie of the character in this conversation, considering their ethnicity: {ethnicity}. 
            The prompt should follow this format (change <these parts> to suit the context of the conversation and how the character looks in a selfie now):
            selfie of <describe the character, e.g. 'a 20-year-old asian girl'> <describe what they're wearing and what they're doing', e.g. 'wearing a bikini and lying on a bed with her arms stretched out'>, <describe the place, e.g. 'in a messy bedroom'>
            
            MAKE SURE to extract where she is from the text, and include that background in the selfie prompt, AND ALSO describe what she's doing according to the text.
            
            <SELFIE PROMPT EXAMPLES>
            selfie of a young american girl wearing a hoodie and glasses under the covers  dark room, grainy, candid, gritty, blurry, low quality
            
            selfie of a young asian girl wearing a a suit and pencil skirt while holding a pen and bending over in front of the bathroom mirror, grainy, candid, gritty, blurry, low quality
            
            a selfie of an asian woman wearing a thong and tank top posing seductively in a dorm room, holding up her hands in surprise, dark room, grainy, candid, gritty, blurry, low quality
            
            IMPORTANT:
